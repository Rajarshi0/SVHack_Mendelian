## What's the problem?

Mendelian inconsistency in SV calls can indicate two possibilities: challenges in SV calling leading to false positive or negative calls across the trio, or a genuine de novo SV. De novo SVs are rare, with an estimated rate of 0.16 de novo SVs per genome in healthy individuals [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059337/]. Despite their rarity, de novo SVs have been associated with autism [REF]. In addition, benchmarking studies have used the former aspect to support the validity of their SV calls. Here, we aim to investigate putative de novo SVs to either validate them, or use their properties to inform strategies for more accurate SV calling.

# What is <this software>?

<This software> is a QC framework tool that creates a local assembly of every novel SV candidate locus in each member of the trio to aid in confirming that the SV is indeed novel in the child.
